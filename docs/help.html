<p>• GameEntity multiplies x & y values by 1/8f - Pretty sure I've also seen places where x & y values have been multiplied by 8f to counter this.</p>
<p>• The value 1/8f is used everywhere. It should be a Constant, so we can change it once and not have to search through the project to refactor everything.</p>
<p>• Rectangles are friends, do not be mean to rectangles.</p>
<p>• Assets folder <b>needs</b> cleaning up.</p>
<p>• Adaptive Viewport</p>
